# Open Fallout Tactics

This repository contains source code for [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) to display sprites from [Fallout Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_Tactics:_Brotherhood_of_Steel).

The goal of this project is mainly to entertain my reverse engineering curiosities.

## Technical details

Since parsing binary files with lua is not feasable with a 60 fps target, I leveraged the LuaJIT [FFI](http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html) library for faster parsing.
